# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It demonstrates how to create a recipe app using basic web development technologies. By the end of this project, I will have learned how to:

- Create a structured HTML layout
- Apply CSS to style a web page
- Implement a responsive design

This project helps me practice and showcase my skills in front-end development.
